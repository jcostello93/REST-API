# REST API

## Summary
This was my final project for my CS493 Cloud Aplication Development course. 

### Entities
There are three entities: Users, Teams, and Players

### Relationships
There exists a one-to-many relationship between users and teams and a one-to-many relationship between teams and players

### Storage
Google Cloud Data Store (NoSQL)

### Authentication/Authorization
JWT tokens and Auth0

### Deployment
Google App Engine

### Status Codes
200, 201, 204, 303, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 406, 415, and 500 codes are all supported and listed in the documentation.

### Tests
I created a Node-RED Application to test the functionality of the API. The code is stored in the Node-RED directory in the repository. To run the tests, create a Node-RED application and import the JSON code.
